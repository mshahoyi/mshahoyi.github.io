AI safety is a broad with many suibfields each prioritising and focusing on different asepcts of making AI safe. Therefore, I decided to crate a mindmap to hopefully capture all these conepts and relationshiops.

The mindmap is currently a very early draft, and I'm still figuring out how to best represent the relationships between the different concepts. Nevertheless, I thought I'd share it anyway. Sorry in advance for the messy edges!
