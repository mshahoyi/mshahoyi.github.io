SARS-CoV-2 (aka Coronavirus) was on rampage in China from the outset of new year. The world (and my country, Kurdistan Regional Government/Iraq) did not care much until about mid-February. Then suddenly, as if the world has woken up, it made all the headlines in every national news across continents. The main reason was the rapid spread of the virus in Italy and Iran at first. This was when the Kurdish government also came to its senses. It closed schools, worship places, markets, and pretty much everything else.

The health ministry decided to establish a telephone hotline for inquiries related to the disease. Answering all these calls was quickly getting unmanageable, so they decided to dedicate more medical personnel to the task. And as is the case with every country nowadays (and a good source of election propaganda), there was a shortage of doctors. That was why the ministry turned its eyes to us, final stage medical students. We were not officially pronounced doctors back then, but we had more than enough medical knowledge to be able to answer simple patient inquiries.

They asked us to participate in this program as volunteers. Seeing this as the nation in need, I felt a patriotic obligation to join.

The majority of the questions we were asked from the people dealt with them having vague and sometimes irrelevant symptoms and wanted to be assured/managed by professionals. So to fill this need I thought "why not create a simple symptom checker app in Kurdish?" The app stores and the web were swarming with symptom checkers but non was in Kurdish. I already had the programming expertise and could do it in less than a month. It was a good project to put to work my programming skills and develop them, meanwhile filling a need from the community.

That way I embarked on the adventure to design and program my app. I decided to go cross-platform instead of native. I had some prior knowledge and experience with Swift but it was long before and had forgotten most of it. So I used React Native, as I was pretty up to date with the framework, especially React.

After 2 to 3 weeks of programming and self-education, this is what I came up with;

...and the Kurdish demo;

I was pretty excited. The UI was clean, minimalistic, and simple, empowering the content. From the user's point of view, it was pretty decent. So now was time to publish it to the respective app stores.

After more than 2 weeks of trying, Apple never gave me a developer account! This is ironic, I am giving them money! I don't see why they did not create the developer account. They never got back to me. The last email from them is the electronic receipt you get after the checkout.

As for Google, things were a tiny bit better. They gave me a developer account and successfully submitted my app for review. After a week or so, they rejected my app and this was their reason;

I can't say I disagree. I was exhausted, however, and did not continue. Also, my medical school resumed studies right around that time. The never-ending medical studying and the stress of finals made me forget about it.

In the end, it was worth it I would say. I have done these for pure enjoyment all my life. It was an exciting project and certainly refreshed my programming skills.
