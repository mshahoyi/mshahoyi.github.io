Greetings from a COVID-19 patient! I am writing this under quarantine while having flu-like symptoms. I have not tested yet, so its not definite that its COVID-19 and maybe just a simple flu. But consider the fact that its mid summer  now and its difficult for the influenza virus to hover around now. So again most probably its COVID-19.

This does not matter, however, as I am totaly fine. I have just quarantined myself for public health reasons. My father is also symptomatic at the moment. We need your prayers üôèüèª.

Ladies and gentlemen, hold and behold, I present to you my own website! 

I should have done this a while ago. In fact, a website is a must these days. It is a professional official platform from you to the world. It is where you can share your thoughts and experiences in detail. It is where you can showcase your work, which can not be emphasized enough for your future job prospects.
