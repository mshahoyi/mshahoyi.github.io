I had a job interview for backend development using Nodejs on 5th Aug 2020. It went well, but they consistently asked whether I had anything using the desired tech to showcase.

The awful answer was no. I had nothing to show.

I tried to justify it. I said I was a medical student up until a month ago. Studying medicine always interrupted me from continueing on my projects. I also did not have any guidance whatsoever. It was me and the internet with the vast amount of its can-be-irrelevant information. I did not have a team, so I could not specialize and the learning curve was always to steep that way.

Nevertheless, I have decided to make a simple prototype to showcase my knowledge in NodeJs and ExpressJs. I will be creating an e-commerce API.

The technologies I am going to use will be Node and Express (obviously!) and MongoDB for the database. If I have the time, I will also create a simple frontend to show things visually.



Lets get our hands dirty.

1. Make a new folder and navigate to it.
