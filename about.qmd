Hi there and welcome ðŸ‘‹ I currently work and research on AI Safety. Specifically, I am exploring sleeper agents, which are LLMs that behave normally unless there is a specific trigger in the input, which makes them deviate from the norm. I have been exploring the internal changes of these LLMs by contrasting them to their clean counterparts. Also, I am interested in red-teaming them by creating a sleeper agent where;

1. The sleeper behaviour is unelicitable, evgen by techniques like [MELBo](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ioPnHKFyy4Cw2Gr2x/mechanistically-eliciting-latent-behaviors-in-language-1).
2. Sleeper behaviour evades latent-space monitors like probes.
3. The sleeper behaviour is robust to removal by adversarial training techniques such as [LAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15549).

If this is your area of interest as well, [let's have a chat!](mailto:muyabb@gmail.com)

Professionally, I am an MSc AI student at ARU in Cambridge, UK. Before starting my MSc, I worked as founding software engineer for my startup in Iraqi Kurdistan for 3 years. We started by building a live trivia game directed towards Iraqi Kurds. Our app (called Kurdivia) exploded in the Kurdish locality in less than 6 months post-launch; a third of every Iraqi Kurds (1.4 million) have played our game at least once. We raised VC funding and after many small pivots, the product evolved into a grocery and food instant-delivery app (ðŸ˜³ I know, right?!) called Padash.
